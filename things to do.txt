shaders coursework:
-research/explain principles of Full Phong shading
-design, write, test a c++/GLSL program to implement full phong shading
-write a report on everything



tasks to be done:
-create a shader program, that renders teapot with ambient, difusse and specular lighting.
-Phong shading is calculated by combining different forms of light to create the overall lighting for a model. 
This light is calculated by combining ambient, diffuse and specular.

-modify the per pixel diffuse shader code to produce a program that displays 
a 3D teapot using full per pixel ambient/diffuse/specular lighting. The current code includes only diffuse lighting.

light basics:
Ambient light represents light which bounces around and is always there.
Diffuse uses directional light to describe which parts of the model should be brighter and which points should be darker.
Finally, specular light effects the shininess of the model.

to debug, put the breakpoint at the exit code in scene diffuse
